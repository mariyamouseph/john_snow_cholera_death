# john_snow_cholera_death
This is a simple representation of John Snow's Cholera map. Data is in .shp file format. I have plotted both the Pump locations and the number of deaths on a coordinate map. The higher the number of deaths the more the size of Death markers. In conclusion, It is evident how Dr. Snow ended up finding the root cause of a cholera outbreak in the 19th Century.
